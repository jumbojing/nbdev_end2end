    "## 本书与众不同的历史\n",
    "\n",
    "1999年1月，我正准备使用Java教一门编程入门课程。我之前已经开了三次课，\n",
    "但是却感到越来越沮丧。课程的不及格率太高，即使对于及格的学生，他们整体的收获也太低。\n",
    "\n",
    "我看到的问题之一是教材。\n",
    "\n",
    "它们都太厚重了，写了太多关于Java的不必要细节，却缺乏如何编程的上层指导\n",
    "（high-level guidance）。这些教材都陷入了陷阱门效应（trap door\n",
    "effect）：开始的时候简单，逐渐深入，然后大概到了第五章左右，基础差的学生就跟不上了。\n",
    "学生们看的材料太多，进展太快，最后，我在接下来的学期里都是在收拾残局（pick\n",
    "up the pieces）。\n",
    "\n",
    "所以，在开始上课前两周，我决定自己写一本书。我的目标是：\n",
    "\n",
    "-   尽量简短。让学生们读10页，胜过让他们读50页。\n",
    "-   谨慎使用术语。我会尽量少用术语，而且第一次使用时，会给出定义。\n",
    "-   循序渐进。为了避免陷阱门，我将最难的主题拆分成了很多个小节。\n",
    "-   聚焦于编程，而不是编程语言。我只涵盖了Java最小可用子集，剔除了其余的部分。\n",
    "\n",
    "我需要一个书名，所以一时兴起，我选择了*《如何像计算机科学家一样思考》*。\n",
    "\n",
    "这本书的第一版很粗糙，但是却起了作用。学生们读了它之后，对书中内容理解的很好，\n",
    "因此我才可以在课堂上讲授那些困难、有趣的主题，并让学生们动手实践（这点最重要）。\n",
    "\n",
    "我将此书以GNU自有文档许可的形式发布，允许用户拷贝、修改和传播此书。\n",
    "\n",
    "有趣的是接下来发生的事。弗吉尼亚一所高中的教师Jeff Elkne采用了我的教材，\n",
    "并改为使用Python语言。他将修改过的书发给了我一份，就这样，我读着自己的书学会了\n",
    "Python。2001年，通过Green Tea Press，我出版了本书的第一个Python版本。\n",
    "\n",
    "2003年，我开始在Olin College教书，并且第一次教授Python语言。\n",
    "与Java教学的对比很明显。学生们遇到的困难更少，学到的更多，开发了更有趣的工程，\n",
    "并且大部分人都学的更开心。\n",
    "\n",
    "此后，我一直致力于改善本书，纠正错误，改进一些示例，新增教学材料，尤其是练习题。\n",
    "\n",
    "最后的结果，就是此书。现在的书名没有之前那么浮夸，就叫《*Think Python*》\n",
    "。下面是一些变化：\n",
    "\n",
    "-   我在每章的最后新增了一个名叫调试的小节。我会在这些小节中，为大家介绍如何发现及避免bug的一般技巧，并提醒大家注意使用Python过程中可能的陷阱。\n",
    "-   我增补了更多的练习题，从测试是否理解书中概念的小测试，到部分较大的项目。大部分的练习题后，我都会附上答案的链接。\n",
    "-   我新增了一系列案例研究——更长的代码示例，既有练习题，也有答题解释和讨论。\n",
    "-   我扩充了对程序开发计划及基本设计模式的内容介绍。\n",
    "-   我增加了关于调试和算法分析的附录。\n",
    "\n",
    "*《Think Python》* 第二版还有以下新特点：\n",
    "\n",
    "-   本书及其中的代码都已更新至Python 3。\n",
    "-   我增加了一些小节内容，还在本书网站上介绍如何在网络浏览器上运行Python。这样，如果你嫌麻烦的话，就可以先不用在本地安装Python。\n",
    "-   在海龟绘图这章中，我没有继续使用自己编写的海龟绘图包`Swampy`，改用了一个更标准的Python包\n",
    "    `turtle`。这个包更容易安装，也更强大。\n",
    "-   我新增了一个叫作“The\n",
    "    Goodies”的章节，给大家介绍一些严格来说并不是必须了解的Python特性，不过有时候这些特性还是很方便的。\n",
    "\n",
    "我希望你能使用该书愉快的工作，也希望它能帮助你学习编程，学会像计算机科学家一样思考，至少有那么一点像。\n",
